README pcsxr

REQUIREMENTS

	libarchive: Enable compressed data-tracks support.
	libcdio:    Enable CD-ROM support.
	libcdda:    Enable compressed CDDA support.

NOTES

	If you get the following error:

		MEMADDR_OP: Assertion `!isreg || reg != X86_TEMP' failed

	Upstream says that an appropriate workaround is to set Config.CPU = 1
	in pcsx(r).cfg, which disables dynamic binary translation in favor of
	a pure interpreter.

	In other words, edit ~/.pcsxr/pcsxr.cfg and set CPU value from 0 to 1.
